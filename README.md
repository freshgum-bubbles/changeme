A set of React hooks to simplify usage of [TypeDI<sup>++</sup>](https://github.com/freshgum-bubbles/typedi) in React applications.

> [!CAUTION]
> This package doesn't work, has no testing, and really doesn't work as eloquently as I'd like it to.
> **Please don't use it in production**, recommend it to friends, or use it as an example of good code.
> This is not a good library -- really, it was created as a theory project, as opposed to something
> you should actually, like... use.
>
> In future, I'm looking to migrate [TypeDI++](https://github.com/freshgum-bubbles/typedi) to a monorepo
> which houses this package: that would make it much easier to manage all these binding libraries, as
> opposed to having them scattered around my GitHub.  As cool as GitHub's Archive Program is, I pity the
> fool who has to rummage around my repositories to end up with... this.
